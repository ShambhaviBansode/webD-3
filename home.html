    <h3>Why online Books are better?</h3>
        <h4>Portable</h4>
        <p>An e-book is lightweight and portable. An e-book-enabled mobile device is much more convenient to bring with you than a whole bag of books. Almost all 97% of young people utilize electronic gadgets such as computers, tablets, phones, and e-readers. Students can review their notes and course materials whenever they choose thanks to the portability of an e-book. Students may now have everything in one spot rather than carrying many volumes.</p>
        
        <h4>Saves Space</h4>
        <p>Another benefit of e-books is that they take up less space. Students do not require a specific storage place, such as a large library or a specific room. To save hundreds of thousands of e-books, all you need is a technology-based reading device, such as a PC, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Furthermore, e-books are safer to store on mobile devices, and kids may quickly transport them from home to school.</p>
        
        <h4>Easy Availability</h4>
        <p>You can download your essential e-books almost instantly, and you can start reading them within minutes. Students no longer have to go somewhere else to get a book physically, nor do they have to wait for them for prolonged periods. Instead of lugging many volumes, e-books allow students to easily access their notes and course materials whenever they choose. You can choose from a variety of books in Dan‚Äôs global e-book collection to meet your requirement.</p>
        
        <h4>Assessment Made Easy</h4>
        <p>Students can test their knowledge with self-assessments included in e-books. It does away with the customary method of ending each chapter with a quiz. To ensure that students recall the information they are reading, e-books include quizzes and exercises throughout the chapter as well as after the chapter closes.</p>
        
        <h4>Saves Environment</h4>
        <p>In university lectures and libraries, e-books and e-readers may provide significant cost savings. This could assist the educational system in reducing the amount of money spent on hard copies of texts and other materials. When it comes to sustainability, E-books may save a lot of money, and more students are declaring that using paper is a selfish act for the earth.</p>
        
        <h4>Search Option</h4>
        <p>This value alone is a benefit of e-books, the preferred option for many students. When it comes to studying and completing assignments, e-books‚Äô functionality makes them highly useful. Plus, just like in a typical textbook, you may bookmark pages and take notes. The search function saves time by eliminating the need to turn pages after pages to find a specific topic or word. They can save pages and chapters as bookmarks. They can rapidly look up the definitions of terms using the online dictionary.</p>
        
        <h4>Interactive Learning with Technology</h4>
        <p>Music, animations, movies, and voice explanations can all be used in an e-book learning module. The video can be paused and reviewed so that students can see it again. Animations are more engaging and interesting, as well as having a higher retention value. Annotations, pen tools, page zoom, search option, read aloud, and other interactive benefits of e-book reading devices.</p>
        
        <h4>Ease of Updating</h4>
        <p>This is one of the unbeatable benefits of e-books. Traditional paperback volumes would need to be reprinted if there was any new content that needed to be added to the syllabus. However, with e-books, all of the learning content is kept in the cloud. You can make modifications to your e-books at any time, and the changes will appear in all of them. As a result, you can always ensure that your pupils have the most up-to-date material with them.</p>
